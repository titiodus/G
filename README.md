# A Birthday GIF-t Site for Jerry Uke

Jerry is part of my tech journey and I just had to create this birthday site for him.

This project was fun to work on, maybe because it had a personal touch to it. Alot of CSS styling were used and I enjoyed getting to know how and when to use them.

Used the shadow effect on text to help deal with the poor contrast score for our color combination
Used multiple selector at once in the CSS
Used Flex along with flex-direction and align-item
Replaced img with a div to enable us declare it as background-image in CSS using url("image path")
Also used background-size property with the cover and when cover did not work, used width and height values
Used the hover effect on the GIFt boxes to reveal the GIFts
Finished it off by making the background colour have a linear-gradient effect
Fun all the way. Best part, this page is 100% responsive.

#### Happy Birthday Jerry
